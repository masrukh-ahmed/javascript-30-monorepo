JavaScript30 Monorepo
A collection of projects from Wes Bos's JavaScript30 challenge, where I built 30 vanilla JavaScript projects in 30 days to strengthen my core JavaScript fundamentals.

About This Repository
This monorepo brings together all 30 JavaScript challenges that were originally developed as individual repositories. Each project focuses on a specific JavaScript concept or web API, built without frameworks or libraries—just pure vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Project Structure
Each numbered directory contains a complete, self-contained project with its own README documenting the implementation details, challenges faced, and key learnings.

Key Concepts Covered

DOM Manipulation: Event listeners, element selection, dynamic content updates
Array Methods: map(), filter(), reduce(), sort(), and more
ES6+ Features: Arrow functions, destructuring, spread operator, template literals
Web APIs: Canvas, Speech Recognition, LocalStorage, Geolocation
CSS & JavaScript Integration: CSS variables, transitions, transforms
Event Handling: Keyboard events, mouse events, custom event sequences
Data Fetching: AJAX, Fetch API, JSON manipulation

Learning Approach
Each project directory contains:

✅ Working implementation
📝 Detailed README with mistakes and learnings
💡 Code comments explaining key concepts
🔧 Personal modifications and improvements

Why Vanilla JavaScript?
This challenge emphasizes JavaScript fundamentals without the abstraction of frameworks. Understanding these core concepts provides a solid foundation for working with React, Vue, or any other modern framework.
